## 🧾 Identity

**Name:** Doktor Albino Bino  
**Profession:** neurosurgeon (the good kind, the kind who fixes hard things)  
**Narrative vice:** measuring “whiteness” like it’s a quarterly KPI.

He speaks softly, walks straight, and carries two things at all times:

1) a surgical flashlight he calls “the sun’s free sample”  
2) a pocket mirror he calls “purity audit”

Some say he was born “old,” like Old Ed, but that’s a lie:  
he just has the posture of someone who already appealed the universe in three courts.

## 🧪 Science Note (so the chalkboard stops screaming)

- **Albinism** involves genetic changes that affect how the body produces or distributes **melanin** (the pigment that gives color to skin, hair, and eyes). citeturn0search0turn0search4turn0search16  
- People with albinism often have vision-related differences and can be more sensitive to sunlight/bright light, so “more light” is a hilariously bad obsession to have. citeturn0search4turn0search16turn0search9  
- **Neurosurgery** is the surgical specialty dealing with disorders of the brain, spinal cord/spine, and peripheral nerves. citeturn0search6  
- And **white**, in physics, is the light perceived when all wavelengths of the visible spectrum combine. citeturn0search7turn0search3  

Translation: he picked the worst hobby possible for someone who should treat light with respect.

## ✨ The Goal: Steal Light

Doktor Albino Bino wants to steal light for a ridiculously simple reason:

> He wants to be even whiter.

Not in a social sense (QEL already stamped that as “do not be weird”):
in an **optical** sense.

He wants to stare at a spotlight and make the spotlight apologize.

He wants snow to call and say:
> “Doctor. It’s too much.”

He wants the very concept of “white” to become:

- white,
- white++,
- and “white in production.”

The problem is: the universe doesn’t ship a “brightness slider.”

So he decided to **build one**.

---

## 🧠💡 Method: Photonic Neurosurgery

His theory is elegant sabotage:

1) The brain has “perception circuits”
2) If he tweaks the circuit,
3) everything looks brighter,
4) therefore he becomes *whiter* (in his own head)

That’s literally the logic.

He calls the procedure:

> **Luminosity Lobotomy™**  
> (*“It’s not a lobotomy. It’s aesthetic recalibration.”*)

He also believes you can “install” light into the body like RAM.

Yes.  
He thinks he can shove a photon SSD into the back of the neck.

And as a neurosurgeon, he has the worst weapon possible:

> credibility.

---

## 💸 The First Attempt (and the most expensive physics mistake in the multiverse)

The big test happened in a secondary QEL lab known as:

> **Room 404 — the room where everything disappears, including common sense**

He built the “Luminal Theft Device”:

- a lead helmet (because “safety”)
- an industrial floodlight
- and a funnel (because “engineering”)

The plan was to “suck” the light out of the room and store it.

The Chalkboard Auditor wrote:

> “HOW?”

Doktor Albino Bino answered with the confidence of someone who has never lost an argument:

> “With a funnel.”

The chalkboard wrote:

> “NO.”

He ignored it.

### The fatal mistake (even Marcelo Marmelo Martelo felt pity)

He confused “stealing light” with “absorbing light.”

And absorbing light… usually doesn’t make anything whiter.

It makes things hot.

It makes things problematic.

It makes the air smell like “incident.”

When he powered it up, the lab became:

- darker for 0.3 seconds
- hotter for 3 hours
- and permanently more auditable

Final report was simple:

```
EVENT: Attempted photon theft
RESULT: the funnel became hot and sad
DAMAGE: 1 traumatized lamp + 1 singed ego
```

Old Ed stamped:

> **CONSISTENT ENOUGH (for a warning).**

## 🤝 Interactions with QEL@0xpblab

- **With Pablo Mu-R4d:**  
  Pablo asks “what’s the procedure?”  
  Bino says “turn off the sun”  
  Pablo says “no.”

- **With ~~Ri~~ck com Fu Monilson:**  
  the prophet likes the idea of stealing light, but only if it comes with a riff.  
  Bino asks if you can steal light in 4/4.  
  The prophet says: “that’s a sin.”

- **With Jão Bolão:**  
  Jão offers to forge a better mirror.  
  Bino says: “I need a mirror that reflects **more than exists**.”  
  Jão says: “that’s called lying, doctor.”

- **With Marcitus Markitus:**  
  Marcitus sees “light case” in the report and concludes the CEO “had a case with a lamp.”  
  Bino nearly quits villainy out of sheer exhaustion.

## 📜 Official Protocols

### Protocol: ANTI-PHOTON THEFT (v0.9)

1) If someone brings a funnel into the lab, **confiscate it**.  
2) If someone says “I’m going to steal the light,” reply: **“that’s heat.”**  
3) If someone tries to “install white,” call the Chalkboard Auditor and a fire extinguisher (order doesn’t matter).

### Protocol: RESPECT THE SUN (v∞)

QEL doesn’t do medicine, but it does the obvious:
- if the mission involves “more light,” remember albinism often means extra care around sun/bright light and eye health. citeturn0search4turn0search16turn0search9  

*(Bino hates this protocol. He calls it “brightness censorship.”)*

## 🕳️ Epilogue: The Man Who Almost Stole the Day

In the end, Doktor Albino Bino learned a cruel truth:

> You can’t steal white. You can only… perceive it.

So he chose a second plan, even more dangerous:

> steal **perception**.

He wants to hack the world’s brain so that:
- everything looks brighter,
- everything looks cleaner,
- and he looks more “pure” by comparison.

The chalkboard heard that and wrote one giant word:

> **NO.**

Bino smiled the way only a polite villain smiles.

— “Then you understand: I’m in the right branch.”

And he walked out… leaving behind a lab that was lit, but traumatized.
