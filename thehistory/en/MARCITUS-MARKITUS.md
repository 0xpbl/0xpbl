## 🧾 Identity

**Name:** Marcitus Markitus  
**Job title (self-assigned):** Case Inspector (romantic cases, criminal cases, and use cases)  
**Special skill:** turning PDFs into soap operas, and soap operas into investigations.

In QEL@0xpblab, where reality branches, Marcitus does the opposite:
he **converges everything** into one storyline—preferably the most scandalous one.

He doesn’t believe in coincidence.

He believes in:
- “pattern”
- “motive”
- and “someone is hiding something (always).”

---

## 👶🕴️ The Son Who Gives “Mini-Me” Energy (but is compliance-approved)

Marcitus has a son. Officially:

**Little Marcitus Markitus** (also known as “The Tiny Compliance Officer”).

People compare the kid to “Mini-Me” for three reasons:

1) he wears a gray suit like a corporate villain uniform  
2) he sticks to his dad with the loyalty of an “emotional clone”  
3) he communicates 80% of reality using only:
   - unblinking eye contact  
   - a minimal smile  
   - and a nod that feels like a silent stamp

**Important:** this is not a “size joke.”  
He’s “mini” in the **narrative** sense: a compact version of his father’s paranoia.

### Compliance Note

After the “Sensitive Meme Incident,” QEL banned turning physical traits into operational jokes.  
So the approved internal label is:

> **“Kid With Clone Energy.”**

And the kid takes it seriously: he carries a clipboard and writes “APPROVED” / “NOT APPROVED” with markers, without ever explaining the rubric.

---

## 💥 The Forbidden CASE Theory

Marcitus Markitus maintains the core thesis of his life:

> **“The company’s CEO had an affair with the wife of a drunk, stuttering guy from quantum space.”**

He doesn’t say “maybe.”

He says “I know.”

And when someone asks “how?”, he says:

> “I have evidence.”

His “evidence” includes:
- calendar screenshots with zero context  
- coffee receipts (because coffee is always suspicious)  
- a slide titled “CASE STUDY” (the smoking gun in his brain)  
- and a 6‑second audio clip of someone saying “ok” (which he calls “low-frequency confession”)

### Where the Misread Began (the saddest + funniest part)

It started when he saw a document saying:

> **“new use case in production”**

He read it as:
> **“new CEO case in production”**

And he has lived in:
**permanent investigation mode** ever since.

## 🥴🛰️ Who the “Drunk, Stuttering Guy from Quantum Space” Is

The alleged betrayed husband goes by many names, depending on the branch:

- **Sergeant Gl–Gl–Grog**  
- **Captain Dr–Dr–Drink**  
- **Agent E–E–Ethanol** (unfair, but efficient)

He’s a low-rank quantumnaut—one of those branch-patrol cops stationed in sectors where:
- reality signal drops  
- and common sense drops with it

### Why does he drink?

Because “quantum space air” isn’t air.

It’s **anxiety in gas form**.

And the only way to calm down is “controlled decoherence ethanol,” which he insists is “medicinal.”

His stutter is not treated as a joke:
it’s framed as a **side effect of crossing poorly optimized branches**.

He tries to say “procedure” and it becomes:
> “p-p-pro… pro… protocol…”

Which, at QEL, counts as paperwork.

## 🚪 First Appearance at QEL@0xpblab

Gate log:

```
EVENT: Subject entered with accordion folder + suit-wearing child
NAME: Marcitus Markitus (self-declared)
OPENING LINE: “I’m here to protect the company… from feelings.”
OBJECT: Foldable cork board (passive-aggressive hazard)
```

The turnstile denied access.

Reason:
```
USER ATTEMPTED TO REGISTER “GOSSIP” AS A DEPARTMENT.
```

Marcitus asked to speak to the CEO.

System replied:
```
YOU MAY NOT “SPEAK TO THE CEO” WITHOUT PROTOCOL.
```

Marcitus pulled out a sheet and said:
> “I have protocol.”

The sheet literally said “PROTOCOL” in giant letters.

The turnstile, humiliated, opened.

---

## 🧷 The Evidence Board (it’s just printed PowerPoint)

Marcitus set up a board in the Communications Room. It’s aesthetic terrorism.

It features:
- red string (classic)  
- sticky notes that say “HMMMM”  
- a CEO photo printed at fax quality  
- and the word **“CASE?”** written 47 times

The Chalkboard Auditor tried to audit it and wrote:

```
EVIDENCE: INCONCLUSIVE.
```

Marcitus replied:
> “Inconclusive is what they WANT you to think.”

The chalkboard gave up and wrote:
```
CONSISTENT ENOUGH.
```

## 📜 Official Protocols

### Protocol: ANTI-CASE (v1.0)

**Goal:** prevent Marcitus from turning “use case” into “love affair.”

Rules:
1. Whenever someone says “use case,” repeat out loud: **“USE CASE”** (three times).  
2. Ban slides containing “CASE” without a clear subtitle.  
3. If Marcitus appears with red string, replace it with blue string (less dramatic).  
4. If he persists, call Old Ed to issue a ticket for “excess narrative.”

### Protocol: KID-COMPLIANCE (v0.2)

If the kid raises the clipboard and writes “NOT APPROVED,” accept it.  
Do not argue.

Arguing with a suit-wearing child creates bad branches.

---

## 🕳️ Epilogue: When Gossip Becomes Infrastructure

Over time, QEL discovered something horrifying:

Marcitus is… useful.

He spots inconsistencies because he is a walking inconsistency.

Where everyone sees:
> “a meeting”

Marcitus sees:
> “a crime”

And sometimes… he’s right.

In the end, he proved nothing.

But he left a legacy:

- every time someone says “case” in the lab  
  the air goes cold  
  and somebody turns off the projector just in case

And the kid only watches.

And writes.

And silently stamps reality.
