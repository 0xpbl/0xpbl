## 🧠 Context (do not repeat the dossier)

You already know who Gaybe-EL is.  
You already know what he does to meetings, rhythm, and office morale.

This document covers **one specific day**, classified as:

> **“Digital De-Instrumentation by Quantum Space Junkies (Pixitos)”**

---

## 🌤️ The Day Starts Normal (which is suspicious)

08:02 — Gaybe-EL arrives with rare calm.

- No metronome clicks.
- No triangle appears.
- No beard vibrations.

The company interprets it as:

> “Maybe today will be a good day.”

Classic mistake.

He checks his phone.  
The phone sends a notification:

> **“Storage almost full.”**

Gaybe-EL smiles.

— “So is the universe.”

At lunch he decides to solve two things:
1) buy a cable (that “worked yesterday”)  
2) message his beloved, proving — once again — his **almost masculine sexuality**, as if love and 5G recognize that category.

He rehearses the message in his head:

> “Hey babe. I’m a man… basically.”

It’s already bad.  
He makes it worse.

---

## 🧿 Pixitos Appear

**Pixitos** are quantum-space junkies: beings who live in zones where reality has latency.

They don’t “mug.”

They “retrieve devices in superposition,” claiming:

> “If you haven’t noticed it’s gone, then it’s not gone in every branch.”

Logically unbearable.  
That’s why it works.

### Signs of Pixitos nearby

- the “I saw the multiverse and hated it” stare
- hands moving in the wrong rhythm
- cheap-energy smell
- and a faint sound of QR codes being generated mid-air

## 🏃‍♂️📵 The Robbery (recorded in irregular meter)

12:13 — Gaybe-EL leaves the building.

12:14 — the universe shifts the meter to 7/8 **without warning**.

12:14.5 — three Pixitos step out from behind a “LIMITED OFFER” sign (evil’s favorite disguise).

They speak in bad sync, like they’re dubbed by a broken radio:

— “H-h-hey, conductor… g-g-give phone.”

Gaybe-EL tries to keep posture.

— “Friend, I’m a harmonic pattern, not an ATM.”

The leader extends a hand:

— “Then harmonize this: *hand it over*.”

Gaybe-EL tries to buy time with art.

He pulls a kazoo from his pocket (because of course he had a kazoo).  
He plays it wrong.  
He should **hmmmm**, but he goes **pfffff**.

Reality takes it as disrespect.

A Pixito steps forward and performs the most dangerous motion in the multiverse:

> **a confident hand into someone else’s pocket.**

Done.

The phone vanishes.

The pocket, out of shame, pretends it was always empty.

---

## 🎼 The Chase (musical, useless, inevitable)

Gaybe-EL runs after them.

Not from anger.

From romantic panic:
without his phone he can’t prove anything — not his existence, not his almost masculinity, not his love.

He tries to shout:

— “Stop! I need to send an absurd message to someone I love!”

The Pixitos run laughing.

Laughing in 7/8.

Gaybe-EL uses conductor technique:

- speeds up
- marks tempo with his elbow
- tries to collapse the street into “phone returned”

Nothing.

Somewhere, the Chalkboard Auditor writes into reality:

> “INCONCLUSIVE.”

Old Ed appears for just long enough to worsen things:

— “Did you file a report in which branch?”

Gaybe-EL answers:

— “In all of them, if I could.”

Old Ed stamps the floor:

> **CONSISTENT ENOUGH.**

And leaves, because helping too much creates precedent.

## 🛍️ Attempt to Buy a New Phone

Gaybe-EL walks into a store.

A sign says:

> **“SMARTPHONES IN 24 INSTALLMENTS (or 24 branches)”**

The clerk asks:

— “Which model?”

Gaybe-EL replies:

— “One that receives messages and isn’t stealable.”

The clerk laughs because it’s the first true joke all day.

The store demands:
- ID
- proof of address
- a selfie holding a paper that says “I AM ME”
- and a “code sent by SMS”

Gaybe-EL freezes.

— “I… don’t have SMS.”

— “Then you can’t.”

The universe collapses an entire branch just to laugh.

He tries paying cash.

The payment terminal says:

> “Approval pending in-app confirmation.”

His soul turns off for a second.

— “My app… is on the stolen phone.”

The terminal replies:

> “Understood. Next.”

The company calls it security.  
Gaybe-EL calls it “ritual punishment.”

## 💔✈️ Romance in Airplane Mode

No phone, he tries alternatives.

### Option 1 — Email
He forgot the password.

Recovery sends a code by SMS.

Reality giggles.

### Option 2 — Physical messenger
He writes a letter.

The service asks for a phone number “for confirmation.”

He tears the letter up and eats the paper just to deny the universe satisfaction.

### Option 3 — Music as communication
He tries to send the message as rhythm.

He plays a sad 7/8 into the air (the worst sadness: irregular).

If his beloved decodes it, great.

If not, also great.  
Because without a phone, even his pain can’t become a status update.

He rehearses the message that will never be delivered:

> “Hey love.  
> I am… I am…  
> a man… almost.  
> And that should be enough…  
> but today I got robbed by Pixitos  
> and now I’m not even ‘almost online’.”

## 🕳️ Epilogue: Starving for Contact

At the end of the day, Gaybe-EL returns to QEL@0xpblab with two things:

- an HDMI cable (that doesn’t work)
- and absolute technological loneliness

He tries to focus on work.

But without a phone he learns a horrible truth:

> The multiverse is huge, but love needs signal.

He looks at his beard.

It vibrates in a minor key.

He whispers:

— “Today I didn’t just lose a device… I lost my chance to perform my almost masculinity in real time.”

The chalkboard writes:

> **SAD. FUNNY. HUMAN.**

And somewhere, in a distant branch, the Pixitos post a photo with his phone.

He never sees it.
