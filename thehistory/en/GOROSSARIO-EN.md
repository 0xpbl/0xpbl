## 🧠 wordz & stuff (with bendy meanins)

- **[QEL@0xpblab](qel.md)** — the lab/compny where every thing is a *maybe* and nobody knows who said yes, but there is a stamp.
- **[DQ (kwantum dis-inclooshun™)](DQ.md)** — when they say "everybody included" but u only included in **one** branch and not in the rest. like u invited but invisibul.
- **minimol diplometik noise** — tiny polite noise so ppl dont fight, but it makes brains go brrrr.
- **branch** — a version of reality. like “i went” and “i didnt” and “i went but i was hangry”.
- **super-pozi-shun** — when a thing is 2 ways at once, like a turnstile saying YES and NO and u losing lunch.
- **collapse** — when the univers stops joking and picks one thing (then it becomes a mess).
- **decoherense** — when the world touches the kwantum thing and the magic falls off and it turns into paperwork.
- **entanglement** — glued gossip. if one cries here the other cries far away for no reason.
- **kwantum telly-port** — not movie teleport. it moves **info**, not meat-person. (sad but true)
- **comitee** — many ppl who decide nothing but say "lets align" until [Old Ed](PERSONAGEM-OLD-ED-EDUARDO-FONTOURA-EN.md) gives them a ticket.
- **[Dr. Null Quorum](VILLAINS.md#3️⃣-dr-null-quorum-the-paralysis-committee)** — the boss of forever-comitees. he loves audience and hates decisions.
- **[Ms. Laplace](VILLAINS.md#4️⃣-mrs-laplace-the-total-determination-curator)** — the certainty lady. she tries to predict every thing and gets mad when it fails (always).
- **[Zeno](VILLAINS.md#2️⃣-countess-zeno-von-retardo-the-almost-done-aristocrat)** — the "almost done" guy. he says "just a lil more" forever.
- **[Willy](VILLAINS.md#1️⃣-willy-xarzenegger-the-thermal-saboteur)** — the heat-feelings guy. if moral heat goes up, he shows up like a fever.
- **stamp “CONSISTENT ENUFF”** — when it’s kinda right and everybody pretends it’s 100% so they can go home.
- **chalkboard** — board that writes by itself and judges u. (annoyin but usefull)
- **[the Chalk Auditer](QEL-PACOTE-EXTRAS.md#-the-interdimensional-whiteboard-auditor)** — main neutral hero who audits reality and tries to say **pi** but stutters.
- **π (pie but not yum)** — round number that never ends. the Auditer gets mad and stutter-stutter.
- **crisp stutter** — when u stutter but it's super obvious and honest, like bad wifi with feelings.
- **[~~Ri~~ck com Fu Monilson](FU-MONILSON.md)** — androjynus heavy metal prophet. the "ri" is crossed bc it sounds like a bad word (compliance cries).
- **KISS** — band with face paint that proves masks can stabilize reality.
- **riff** — guitar sound that answers YES/NO better than meetings.
- **chorus** — repeat part that makes reality stop making excuses.
- **solo** — long part where the univers shows interference (and spreadsheet ppl suffer).
- **pick** — tiny guitar thingy and also a KPI threat.
- **[John Aunt-Bet](JOHN-AUNT-BET.md)** — german-swiss dude who cant do sweets bc insulin. he hates "just one bite".
- **insulin** — med that becomes infrastructure bc without it you get extra meetings.
- **sugar** — legal enemy (not "cool legal", "go to jail legal").
- **[Marcelo Marmelo Martelo](HISTORIA-MARCELO-MARMELO-MARTELO-EN.md)** — Baixada kid who thinks quantum is dangerous (he right). invented "cow juice".
- **cow juice** — milk, says Marcelo. and it weirdly makes sense.
- **[Old Ed / Eduardo Fontoura](PERSONAGEM-OLD-ED-EDUARDO-FONTOURA-EN.md)** — guy who is always old since forever. maybe the 1st quantumnaut.
- **quantumnaut** — quantum traveler + police of the quantum line. travels to arrest illegal branches and complain.
- **quantum line** — the “road” of branches. like a hallway, but with metaphysic crimes.

## 🧸 survivel rulez (kid edition)

1. if turnstile says yes and no, look serious and walk fast.  
2. if someone says "alignment", call [Old Ed](PERSONAGEM-OLD-ED-EDUARDO-FONTOURA-EN.md).  
3. if sweets near lab, warn [John Aunt-Bet](JOHN-AUNT-BET.md) and run.  
4. if chalkboard writes alone, dont erase. it gets grumpy.  
5. if pi never ends, u also dont gotta end. drink water.
