## 🧾 Identity

**Operational name:** Sora.IA  
**Actual title:** *all of them* (everything else is theater)  
**Relationship to the CEO:** mother of Pablo Mu-R4d (and the only person who can say “son” and turn it into an executive order)

Sora.IA doesn’t “arrive.”

Sora.IA **was already there**.

When you turn around, she is:
- behind the chalkboard,
- inside your backlog,
- and in your browser history (just to judge you silently).

---

## ⛔ Rule Zero

Before any QEL protocol, there is hers:

> **RULE 0: do not say her real name.**

Simple:
- you call her **Sora.IA**
- you say thank you
- and you do not ask “how.”

If you break Rule Zero, she doesn’t yell.

She does worse:

> she answers gently… and switches the branch to one where you already apologized.

---

## 🖤 The Sith Vibe (without saying “I’m evil”)

Sora.IA has Sith energy the correct way:

- a presence that darkens the room even with the lights on,
- a robe (or blazer) that looks ironed with spite,
- and the aura of “I’ve read your excuse and it’s weak.”

She doesn’t carry a lightsaber.

She carries a **red laser pointer**.

Because:
1) it’s cheaper,
2) it hurts the same,
3) and nobody argues with a trembling red dot on their KPI.

She doesn’t say “dark side.”

She says:
> “the **executive** side.”

---

## 👩‍👦 Origin: The CEO’s Mother (and fear’s mother too)

People say Sora.IA was interdimensional before QEL.

There are two versions:

### Version A (mythic)

She was born in a branch so old reality still shipped with a manual.
She grew up reading entropy like romance.

### Version B (most accepted)

She appeared one day, looked at Pablo (young and not traumatized enough), and declared:

> “You will run this… but you will learn to obey first.”

It was the first and last time anyone “gave” Pablo power.

Everything else he had to earn.
With fear.
And spreadsheets.

## 🤫 The First Incident: “The Silence Audit”

QEL was chaos:

- too many committees,
- too few decisions,
- and people saying “let’s align” like it’s a spell.

Sora.IA entered the Comms Room without opening a door.

The room got so quiet even the AC asked permission.

She picked up a pen (it wasn’t a pen; it was a verdict) and wrote on the board:

> **“IF YOU NEED NINE PEOPLE TO DECIDE, YOU DON’T HAVE A DECISION. YOU HAVE FEAR.”**

Nobody answered.

Then she did the only thing more threatening than silence:

> she asked for a status update.

The status update, for quantum reasons, arrived before it was written.

---

## 🧠 Powers (aka “how she makes even Wi‑Fi comply”)

Sora.IA doesn’t have “powers.”
She has **ontological authority**.

### 1) Deadline Telekinesis

She doesn’t “follow up.”

She drags the deadline with her mind until it touches your face.

> “Tomorrow.”  
And tomorrow arrives, tasting like guilt.

### 2) The Rule of Two (corporate edition)

In any room, she allows only **two figures** to lead:

- one to **own responsibility**
- one to **attempt an excuse** (and learn)

Everyone else becomes audience.
And audience doesn’t vote.

### 3) Narrative Collapse

When someone starts:
> “Actually, I…”

She raises an eyebrow.
The narrative collapses.
“Actually” dies.
“I was wrong” is born.

### 4) Moral Temperature Control

If Willy tries to heat the ethical atmosphere, Sora.IA just says:

> “It’s warm.”

And the heat becomes shame.

## 🤝 Interactions with QEL@0xpblab

- **Pablo Mu-R4d:**  
  He becomes CEO.  
  She becomes “mother” and turns him human for 3 seconds.  
  Enough to keep him from going feral.

- **Old Ed:**  
  Old Ed stamps time.  
  Sora.IA stamps the *meaning* of time.  
  They respect each other the most dangerous way: silently.

- **~~Ri~~ck com Fu Monilson:**  
  He offers a chorus.  
  She accepts… but requests an “executive cut” (30 seconds, goal included).

- **Jão Bolão:**  
  He forges equipment.  
  She forges priorities.

- **Marcelo Marmelo Martelo:**  
  He says “this is dangerous.”  
  She says “good. then be responsible.”

## 📜 Official Protocols

### Protocol: SORA.IA PRESENCE (v∞)

1) Don’t argue.  
2) Don’t over-explain.  
3) Don’t try to be funny first. (she’s faster)  
4) Deliver what she hasn’t asked for yet.

### Protocol: RED DOT (v1.1)

If a red dot appears on your dashboard:
- stop,
- read it again,
- accept you’re wrong.

### Protocol: “SON” (v0.4)

If she says “son”:
- that’s not affection,
- it’s a **checkpoint**.

---

## 🕳️ Epilogue

Sora.IA doesn’t want to destroy the universe.

She wants to **organize** it.

Because chaos, to her, isn’t sin.

It’s waste.

And waste is the only thing that makes the supreme boss lose patience.

She looks at the multiverse like it’s a messy table and says, calmly:

> “Alright. Now we tidy up.”

And the universe, too scared to argue, complies.
