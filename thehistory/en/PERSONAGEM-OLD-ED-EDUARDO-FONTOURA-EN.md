## 🧾 Identity & Paradox

**Legal name:** Eduardo Fontoura  
**Operational name:** Old Ed  
**Species:** human (allegedly)  
**Age:** **yes**  
**Default state:** “old” — not “old by years,” but “old as a concept.”

QEL@0xpblab has an unspoken rule:

> If the universe offers a paradox, HR turns it into a job title.

Old Ed is the first documented case of someone hired by the lab **before the lab existed**.

He showed up “on day one” already equipped with:
- lower back pain
- strong opinions about everything
- and a pen that only works on paper from 1974

## 🕳️ Origin: Before Before

There are three official origins for Old Ed.

None match.

Therefore, all are true.

### Version A — “The First Jump”
Some say Old Ed was the first human to cross the Quantum Line, before anyone coined the phrase “Quantum Line.”

He fell into the multiverse the way you board the wrong bus:
uninvited, but complaining like it was the driver’s fault.

### Version B — “Born Already Antique”
Others swear he was born old—like a newborn leaving the hospital saying:

> “Where’s my coffee?”

### Version C — “The Chrononaut Label”
In certain branches he’s called a **chrononaut**—a “time traveler,” a sci‑fi term for people who move through time.【turn0search0†L1-L4】

Old Ed hates it.

> “Chrononaut is time travel with glamour.  
> I travel because someone committed a crime.”

## 🧭 What a Quantumnaut Is (and why it’s a terrible job)

**Quantumnauts** are quantum travelers and **quantum-line police**: people who patrol branches, duct‑tape reality back together, and ticket the universe for misbehavior.

Problem: physics doesn’t care about badges.

And when you attempt “quantum travel,” reality answers with two scientific curse words:

1) **quantum teleportation**: transfers **quantum information** via entanglement + classical communication—*not matter*【turn0search6†L1-L4】—and relies on a shared entangled state plus classical bits【turn0search10†L1-L2】  
2) **decoherence**: the environment “touches” the system and your quantumness turns into paperwork dust.【turn0search7†L13-L20】

Meaning: you don’t “go” with your body.  
You go with **what the universe remembers about you**.

Old Ed calls this:

> “Copy with interest.”

## 👴 Why Old Ed Is “Always Old”

QEL@0xpblab’s best explanation (best meaning: nobody could refute it without crying) is:

- Each jump “teleports” Old Ed’s information, not matter【turn0search6†L1-L4】
- Decoherence eats the edges of the state (like moths on documents)【turn0search7†L13-L20】
- The universe reconstructs him with minimal effort: **a fully baked old man**, because “old” is a stable state.

Result:

> Old Ed is always old because the multiverse trusts old people more than young versions filled with hope.

And since the Quantum Line is police work, he’s always on duty.

Old Ed doesn’t age.

He just gets re‑issued as “legacy edition.”

## 🚪 First Appearance at QEL@0xpblab

Port gate logs (Door A **or** B) state:

```
EVENT: Entity arrived (appearance: classic elderly)
DOCUMENT: “Senior Quantumnaut” ID card with expiration date: before dates existed
OBJECT: A stamp that smells like history
OPENING LINE: “Which comedian opened another branch?”
```

The turnstile tried to deny him.

System error: “user has no valid birth date.”

Old Ed simply held his stamp near the reader.

The reader **apologized**.

```
ACCESS GRANTED
REASON: FEAR
```

Inside, the [Interdimensional Whiteboard Auditor](QEL-PACOTE-EXTRAS.md#-the-interdimensional-whiteboard-auditor) wrote "π = 3." as a test.

Old Ed looked and said:

> "Correct. If you want more digits, run an exam."

The Auditor trembled.

Reality spawned a new branch called **“respect.”**

## 🚓 Quantum Line Police Protocols

### Protocol: PATROL (v0.01 — written in charcoal)

**Goal:** prevent illegal branches from becoming committees ([Dr. Null Quorum](VILLAINS.md#3️⃣-dr-null-quorum-the-paralysis-committee) risk) and stop performative certainty ([Ms. Laplace](VILLAINS.md#4️⃣-mrs-laplace-the-total-determination-curator) risk).

**Old Ed’s rules:**
1. If someone says “alignment,” issue a ticket.
2. If someone says “just a hypothesis,” open an investigation.
3. If reality feels comfortable, assume a crime.
4. If a [prophet](FU-MONILSON.md) appears with an imaginary guitar, let them play (music is structured noise; it works).

### Standard gear

- 1 stamp: “CONSISTENT ENOUGH”
- 1 watch that only points to “before”
- 1 notebook where everything becomes “protocol”
- 1 finite patience (recharged with coffee)

## 📁 Notable Incidents

### Incident 12 — “Causality Theft”
Old Ed arrested a chain of events for “walking without documents.”

> “Event without cause is a vagrant.  
> To the station.”

### Incident 41 — "Certainty Smuggling"
[Ms. Laplace](VILLAINS.md#4️⃣-mrs-laplace-the-total-determination-curator) tried selling "predictability" in the hallway.

Old Ed confiscated it.

> “Certainty here only with a receipt and 7‑day returns.”

### Incident 77 — "Sweets in a Controlled Area"
[John Aunt‑Bet](JOHN-AUNT-BET.md) was right: dessert near the lab is a weapon.

Old Ed put up tape:

> "SUGAR = HIGH‑RISK SUBSTANCE.  
> SUBJECT TO SEIZURE AND JOKES."

[Marcelo Marmelo Martelo](HISTORIA-MARCELO-MARMELO-MARTELO-EN.md) signed underneath:
> "Agreed. Also milk is cow juice."

## 📎 Appendices

### Appendix A — Minimal glossary (so you don’t die in your first branch)

- **Chrononaut:** a sci‑fi word meaning time traveler.【turn0search0†L1-L4】  
- **Quantum teleportation:** moves *quantum information*, not matter【turn0search6†L1-L4】; uses entanglement + classical communication【turn0search10†L1-L2】  
- **Decoherence:** loss of coherence via interaction with the environment【turn0search7†L13-L20】 (aka “the universe touched it and ruined it”)

### Appendix B — Old Ed's signature lines

- "I'm not old. I'm compatible."
- "If the branch is illegal, I stamp it and disappear."
- "If π won't end, that's its problem. I end the report."
- "Everything 'new' is just 'old without supervision.'"
