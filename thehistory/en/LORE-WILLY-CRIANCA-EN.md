## 🧩 Context

Before **Adult Willy** became a living audit problem with suspicious warmth, there was Kid Willy:  
a small creature with infinite energy and a unique ability to:

- sit still for 2 seconds,
- and spend the other 58 running *spite in the background*.

He grew up in Cruzilia, which isn’t exactly a city; it’s an “urban concept” with a cousin in another dimension.  
The street had three things:

1) dust,  
2) a dog that judged everyone,  
3) and a kid trying to prove, with science, that **everything that goes wrong is the environment’s fault**.

## 🖥️ The Quantum Childhood Computer

His dad (or an uncle who “knew tech” because he owned a floppy disk) brought home the neighborhood’s first **quantum childhood computer**:

> **Q-Baby v0.6 (School Edition / “Cheap, but Interdimensional”)**

### Specs (according to Willy, who lied with confidence)

| Part | Spec |
|------|------|
| CPU | “Pentium maybe” (branch-dependent) |
| RAM | 32 MB **in theory** / 31 MB **in practice** |
| Storage | 650 MB **with luck** / 649.8 MB when the universe is petty |
| GPU | 8 MB of VRAM and **hurt feelings** |
| API | DirectX 6.1 **(but only if nobody looks)** |
| Peripherals | stiff keyboard, jumping mouse, and a household fan aimed at the side panel |

It was quantum because:

- when he opened “My Computer,” there was space;
- when he installed a game, the space collapsed into “missing 0.2 MB”;
- and when he cried, the system *rebooted out of empathy*.

## 😤 The Trauma: Diablo II Wouldn’t Run

Willy discovered **Diablo II** and decided that was his destiny:  
not to save the world… but to **run the game**.

The universe answered with an error so spiritual it became doctrine:

> **“Not enough memory”**

He had everything “almost” right in the cruelest way:

- “32 MB” that became 31 MB as soon as the game was *observed*  
- “650 MB free” that vanished when his mom opened Paint  
- “DirectX 6.1” that was actually “6.0.999999 (future improvement)”

Willy tried every child-approved fix:

- blowing on the CD (like it was a cartridge)
- yelling at the monitor (like it had self-esteem)
- turning it off and on “harder”
- placing the PC in the fridge for 12 seconds (until the yelling started)

With every attempt, he learned a law:

> **The world doesn’t break in front of you. It lets you almost get there.**

He didn’t interpret it as frustration.

He interpreted it as:

> **mission.**

## 🧒📚 The Birth of the Gorossário

Without Diablo II, Willy needed something else to conquer.

He found a notebook and did what every kid does when they lose:

> he built an entire system to prove it wasn’t his fault.

And so the **Gorossário** was born.

Not “glossary,” because he wasn’t writing… he was *shouting in graphite*.

He wrote everything with crooked letters, rage scribbles, and “strategic spelling mistakes,” because:

1) he was six,  
2) he was gifted,  
3) and reality had already begun sabotaging his orthography.

The Gorossário wasn’t made to teach.

It was made to **accuse**.

Every term was a small revenge:

- against “minimum requirements”
- against “compatible, technically”
- against “it works on my cousin’s PC”

When asked “why did you write all this?”, he said:

> “So when I grow up, I remember *who* humiliated me: the system.”

## 🧑‍🏫 The Computer Class That Became an Incident

At school, there was “computer class day.”

The teacher said:

> “Today we’re learning to defragment.”

Willy heard:

> “Today we’re learning to **rearrange reality**.”

He opened the school PC, stared at the desktop, and asked:

> “Can this run Diablo II?”

The teacher replied with the worst possible adult sentence for a lab-minded child:

> “I don’t know.”

Willy wrote in the Gorossário:  
**“I DUNNO = SYSTEMIC FAILURE WITH PRIDE”**

He tried installing anyway.

When an error popped up, he didn’t get sad.

He got **technical**.

He grabbed a desk fan and declared:

> “If it’s memory, it’s heat. If it’s heat, it’s environment. If it’s environment, it’s your fault.”

The teacher, utterly lost, said:

> “Willy, it’s just a computer.”

Willy, already living in the future:

> “Nothing is ‘just’ anything. It’s all a system trying to convince you you didn’t notice.”

The lab got weirdly warm.

Nobody proved anything.

But everybody felt it.

## 🕳️ How This Becomes Villainy

Years later, when someone asks:

> “Why do you make things look ‘normal’ while everything quietly gets worse?”

The answer is here:

Willy learned early that the trick isn’t to break the game.  
It’s to make the game **run** while you slowly murder the joy.

Because that’s what happened to him:

- the PC *almost* ran it,
- the download *almost* finished,
- the disk space *almost* worked.

He grew up with one goal:

> **If I can’t have my Diablo II… nobody gets clean experiments.**

And that’s his aesthetic:

- degrade without a trace,
- heat without smoke,
- and smile when someone says “must be the AC.”
