## ⚠️ Compliance Note (Quantum)

This is the **“official-unofficial”** catalog of TV programs produced (or allegedly produced) by **The Quantum Experimental Laboratories at 0xpblab (QEL@0xpblab)**.

### 📺 Official position of the lab

They insist these are **“mass-communication experiments,”** not television.

**The public, broadly speaking, disagrees.**

### 📊 About real programs mentioned

When real programs are referenced, it is in the tone of **satire** and **popular reputation** (what the lab would call a **cultural-decoherence metric**), not a definitive technical judgement.

## 📺 Original Programs by QEL@0xpblab

### 1️⃣ Schrödinger’s Reality Show

<div align="center">

![Format](https://img.shields.io/badge/format-CONTAINMENT%20REALITY-purple)
![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-ACTIVE%20SUPERPOSITION-blue)
![Seasons](https://img.shields.io/badge/seasons-3%20(or%204)-orange)

</div>

#### 📖 Premise

Contestants are **eliminated AND winners at the same time** until the live broadcast.

#### ⭐ Highlight

The audience votes, but the vote is only **“observed”** at the last second — and sometimes the result changes when the camera cuts back to the host.

#### 🎬 Show mechanics

```javascript
class SchrodingersReality {
  constructor() {
    this.participants = [];
    this.superpositionState = true;
  }

  voting() {
    // Votes exist but are not observed
    this.votes = collectVotes();
    this.votes.observed = false;
  }

  live() {
    // Moment of observation
    const result = this.collapse();

    // Sometimes it changes when the camera cuts
    if (Math.random() > 0.7) {
      return this.collapseAgain();
    }

    return result;
  }
}
```

#### 💬 Iconic lines

- “You’re eliminated… or not. We’ll find out after the break.”
- “Congratulations! You win in at least one branch of reality.”

![Time](https://img.shields.io/badge/time-8pm%20(tomorrow)-blue)
![Accuracy](https://img.shields.io/badge/accuracy-RETROACTIVE-orange)

</div>

#### 📖 Premise

News is presented **24 hours in advance**, then corrected retroactively via a footnote ticker.

#### 📰 Recurring segment

**“Forecast of what already happened”**

#### ⚖️ Side effect

The show sued its own rundown for **temporal defamation**.

#### 🎬 Sample segment

</div>

#### 📖 Premise

The winner is whoever produces the most **“thermodynamically organized”** dish.

#### 👨‍🍳 Guest judge

The cryogenics team.

#### 💬 Catchphrase

> **“Your risotto is too probable; we need more uncertainty.”**

#### 🎬 Scoring criteria

| Criterion | Weight | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Entropy** | 40% | The more organized, the better |
| **Temperature** | 30% | Preference for cold dishes |
| **Uncertainty** | 20% | The dish should surprise thermally |
| **Coherence** | 10% | Ingredients must be in phase |

#### 🏆 Winning dishes

- Liquid-nitrogen ice cream (Season 1)

### 4️⃣ The Copenhagen Farm

<div align="center">

![Format](https://img.shields.io/badge/format-RURAL%20REALITY-green)
![Animals](https://img.shields.io/badge/animals-STATISTICAL%20TREND-blue)
![Location](https://img.shields.io/badge/location-DENMARK%20(±)-orange)

</div>

#### 📖 Premise

The animals only exist as a **“statistical trend”** until someone counts them.

#### 🐓 Classic moment

The “rooster” was measured and became **“a rooster concept.”**

#### 🎬 Rules

```python
class CopenhagenFarm:
    def __init__(self):
        self.animals = {
            'chickens': ChickenProbability(),
            'cows': CowTrend(),
            'pigs': PigSuperposition()
        }

    def count_animals(self, kind):
        """
        Counting collapses the wavefunction.
        """
        if not self.animals[kind].has_been_observed:
            # Before counting: statistical trend
            return f"Approximately {kind}"
        else:
            # After counting: may become a concept
            result = self.animals[kind].collapse()
            if result.kind == "concept":
                return f"A {kind} concept"
            return result.quantity
```

#### 📊 Farm inventory

- **Chickens:** ~12 (unconfirmed)
- **Cows:** 3 or 4 (observer-dependent)
- **Pigs:** Pig concept
- **Rooster:** Measured (now a concept)

### 5️⃣ Family Cases in Superposition

<div align="center">

![Versions](https://img.shields.io/badge/versions-2%20SIMULTANEOUS-purple)
![Resolution](https://img.shields.io/badge/resolution-COHERENT-green)

</div>

#### 📖 Premise

Two versions of the same family conflict are presented **in parallel**.

#### 🎯 Finale

The audience decides which version is **“more real.”**

#### 💬 Recurring complaint

> No one leaves reconciled, but everyone leaves **“coherent.”**

#### 🎬 Episode structure

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  SPLIT SCREEN                                        │
├──────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┤

│   said that I…”       │   she’s the one who…”        │
│                      │                              │
│  [Both true until the vote]                          │
│                      │                              │
│  RESULT: Version A is “more real” (51% of votes)     │
│  Version B persists as an “alternate branch”         │

## 📺 Real Programs that QEL@0xpblab Swears it Produced

> These entries are documented as **“adopted reputations.”** The lab says it merely supplied *methods*. The world insists it supplied *content*.

### 6️⃣ The Office (Corporate Decoherence Edition)

According to QEL@0xpblab, *The Office* is a long-form experiment proving that:

- bureaucracy is a quantum system
- meetings collapse outcomes
- and humor is the cheapest stabilizer

**Lab note:** “Too reproducible. Suspicious.”

### 7️⃣ Black Mirror (Audit Mirror)

The lab claims partial credit for *Black Mirror* because it treats technology as:

- a probability amplifier
- a moral thermostat
- and a bug report generator

**Lab note:** “Accurate, but too stylish. The universe will copy it.”

### 8️⃣ MythBusters (Interference-First Protocol)

QEL@0xpblab alleges it advised on testing methodology:

- build the rig
- observe the failure
- and only then theorize (preferably in an appendix)

**Lab note:** “Proper. Still, they observed too much.”
