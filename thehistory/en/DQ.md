## ✅ What is Quantum De-Inclusion?

While classical companies practice **inclusion** (“everyone in”), the [QEL@0xpblab](qel.md) practices **Quantum De-Inclusion™**:  
a corporate method to keep every employee **included in at least one branch**, and **excluded from all the others** — for reasons of:

- human scalability
- emotional latency
- and, above all, **calendar survival**

**Official definition (audit-friendly):**
> “A policy for probabilistic allocation of belonging with eventual consistency.”

**Real definition (coffee-friendly):**
> “You’re on the team. Just don’t ask which version.”

## 📌 Benefits (according to the Board)

| Benefit | Translation | Side effect |
|---|---|---|
| “Reduces friction” | Nobody finds anybody | Everything becomes an email with “maybe” |
| “Increases autonomy” | You never get context | You become context |
| “Improves diversity” | Diversity of excuses | 17 excuses in parallel |
| “Avoids toxicity” | Avoids people | Also avoids work |

---

## 🧑‍💼 How it works in practice (real examples, technically)

#### 1) Meetings with chairs in superposition
Every meeting has:
- 3 people present
- 12 people “invited”
- 47 people “mapped as stakeholders”
- 1 empty chair labeled: **“Representative of All People”**

The chair votes by interference.

#### 2) “You’re included — you just haven’t been observed”
You only become part of the project when someone:
- mentions you
- adds you
- or blames you

Until then, you exist as **corporate probability**.

#### 3) “Inclusion by absence”
If you weren’t called:
- **you are protected**
If you were called:
- **you are at risk**
If you were called and accepted:
- **you are the risk**

## 🧾 Official metrics (OKRs 100% compatible with cynicism)

**OKR Q1: Diversity**
- KR1: Increase diversity of realities from 3 to 6
- KR2: Guarantee at least 1 employee in “Unread” state
- KR3: Reduce “absolute inclusion” to **0%** (target met since 1973)

**OKR Q2: Belonging**
- KR1: Make each person feel part of the team for 11 seconds/week
- KR2: Expand the feeling of belonging to After Hours (which never happens)
- KR3: Create a committee to define what “feeling” is (proposed by [Dr. Null Quorum](VILLAINS.md); approved at infinity)

## 🧪 The DQ Protocol (v2.56) — implemented by HR (or by fate)

```python
class QuantumDeInclusion:
    """Keeps the environment healthy by ensuring no one is included enough
    to develop expectations.
    """

    def include(self, person, team):
        # Inclusion exists, but should not be observed too early
        person.state = "included_in_at_least_one_branch"
        person.context = None  # context creates attachment
        return "Welcome. (no details)"

    def exclude(self, person, meeting):
        # Exclusion is not personal: it is infrastructure
        if meeting.participants > 7:
            return "Excluded for Anti-Null-Quorum protection"
        if meeting.agenda.contains("alignment"):
            return "Excluded due to semantic loop risk"
        return "Excluded by default (best practice)"

    def promote(self, person):
        # Promotion is collapse: avoid.
        return "Promoted in one branch. In the other, nothing changed. Congrats (?)"
```

## ⚠️ Compliance note: Classical inclusion is prohibited

At QEL@0xpblab, classical inclusion (linear, total, human) is considered:

- **social determinism in disguise** (threat: [Mrs. Laplace](VILLAINS.md))
- **a committee trigger** (threat: [Dr. Null Quorum](VILLAINS.md))
- **a promise that becomes an SLA** (threat: [Countess Zeno](VILLAINS.md))
- **moral heat** (threat: [Willy Xarzenegger](VILLAINS.md))

Therefore, Quantum De-Inclusion™ is the only acceptable form of “culture.”

## 📎 Institutional phrases (for badges and for trauma)

- “Everyone belongs here — just not at the same time.”
- “You’re invited. The meeting just hasn’t decided yet.”
- “Full transparency, but with [minimum noise](COLD-WAR.md).”
- “If you understood your role, report it immediately. That’s a leak.”
- “Our HR doesn’t fire. It collapses your relevance.”

---

## ✅ Checklist: You were successfully de-included

- [ ] You received an invite with no context.
- [ ] You joined the meeting and discovered it was a different meeting.
- [ ] Someone said “let’s align” and nobody died (yet).
- [ ] You left with an action item that was overdue before it existed.
- [ ] You felt part of the team for exactly 11 seconds.

**If you checked 3 or more:** congratulations — you are fully de-included.
