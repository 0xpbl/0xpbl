## 👔 Pablo Mu-R4d

![Pablo Mu-R4d](img/Pablo.png)

**Position:** President & CEO  
**Since:** 1932  
**Age:** 38 years old (quantum accounting)

Since 1932, QEL@0xpblab's President & CEO has been Pablo Mu-R4d — and, in a way that is perfectly consistent with the lab's quantum accounting, he is only 38 years old. The board logs this as a *"benign side effect of a rigorous youth-conservation policy via selective decoherence"*.

## 🕵️‍♂️🧷 Marcitus Markitus

![Marcitus](img/Marcitus.png)

**Position:** Case Analyst  
**Specialty:** Seeing "A CASE" in everything (even in slides)  
**Case types:** Romantic cases, criminal cases, and use cases

Marcitus Markitus, case analyst (romantic cases, criminal cases, and use cases) at QEL@0xpblab. Turns PDFs into soap operas and soap operas into investigations. Believes the CEO had an "affair" with the wife of a drunk, stuttering guy from quantum space (confused "use case" with "romantic case").

## 🥭🔨 Marcelo Marmelo Martelo

![Marcelo](img/Marcelo.png)

**Origin:** Baixada Fluminense  
**Title:** A Baixada Kid vs. the Quantum Universe  
**Specialty:** Translating quantum concepts into Baixada dialect

Marcelo Marmelo Martelo, a Rio kid from Baixada Fluminense who arrived at QEL@0xpblab at 09:17 (±UTC), after the Prophet's visit. Became the lab's social stabilizer, creating the "Anti-Quantum Survival Dictionary" and directly confronting the Interdimensional Whiteboard Auditor.

## ⚒️🧱 Jão Bolão

![Jão Bolão](img/Jão.png)

**Position:** Equipment Builder  
**Location:** Forge Δ  
**Specialty:** Forging operational artifacts

Jão Bolão, the smith everyone swears is a dwarf, but he's actually normal-sized. Works at Forge Δ, where he builds operational artifacts that prevent the universe from turning into a meeting. Speaks little, hammers a lot, and has the professional morality of a mythical smith: if you can't take the heat, don't request the feature.

## 👶🔥 Kid Willy

![Kid Willy](img/bebewilly.png)

**Title:** The Mini-Thermodynamic Menace  
**Origin:** Cruzilia (childhood)  
**Specialty:** High-temperature frustration and background spite processing

Kid Willy, the childhood version of the future villain Willy Xarzenegger. Before becoming an audit problem with suspicious warmth, Willy was a child with infinite energy and a unique ability to process spite in the background. Grew up in Cruzilia trying to prove, with science, that everything that goes wrong is the environment's fault.

**Specialty:** Moral Heat  
**Threat:** Makes science technically correct and useless

Willy Xarzenegger is one of the four antagonists that make science technically correct and useless. Together with Countess Zeno von Retardo, Dr. Null Quorum, and Mrs. Laplace, they form the Impossibility Quartet — the four forces that push reality toward classical failure modes.

## 🛸🖤🔺 Sora.IA

![Sora.IA](img/soraia.png)

**Position:** Supreme Interdimensional Boss  
**Relationship:** Mother of Pablo Mu-R4d  
**Specialty:** Maternal governance and ontological authority

Sora.IA doesn't "arrive." Sora.IA was already there. The supreme interdimensional boss who controls the branch where you think you decide. Mother of the CEO and the only person who can say "son" and turn it into an executive order. She doesn't want to destroy the universe — she wants to organize it.

Sora.IA has been interdimensional since before QEL existed. When you turn around, she is behind the chalkboard, inside your backlog, and in your browser history. She has a presence that darkens the room even with the lights on, and the aura of "I've read your excuse and it's weak." She doesn't carry a lightsaber — she carries a red laser pointer. Because it's cheaper, it hurts the same, and nobody argues with a trembling red dot on their KPI.

Before any QEL protocol, there is Rule Zero: do not say her real name. You call her Sora.IA, you say thank you, and you do not ask "how." If you break Rule Zero, she doesn't yell. She answers gently and switches the branch to one where you already apologized.
