## 🧾 Identity & Pronunciation

**Name:** John Aunt-Bet  
**Nationality:** German-Swiss (a combination that ships with a manual, a watch, and guilt)  
**Informal pronunciation (PT-BR lore):** *"Djôn Anti-Béti"*  
**Official QEL pronunciation:** **[NOT RECOMMENDED NEAR CAKE]**

QEL@0xpblab attempted to register the name in its systems and received:

```
ERROR: Identity detected as an unintentional joke.
WARNING: Do not laugh in an instability lab.
ACTION: Create folder "Metaphysics / Pastry".
```

> **Compliance note:** He didn’t choose the name. The universe chose. He just pays for it.

---

## 🧠 Operational Background

John Aunt-Bet did not arrive at QEL@0xpblab through recruiting.

He arrived by **thermodynamic necessity**.

The first mention appears in a Section Δ-13 memo (reconstructed from cookie crumbs and embarrassment):

> “We need someone who understands precision, discipline, and the ability to say ‘no’ to beautiful things.”

He was described as:

- punctual by trauma
- organized by vocation
- an auditor by instinct
- and dangerously capable of **refusing dessert in public**, which in any culture functions as a weapon

---

## 🍭 Cultural Allergy to Sweets

John Aunt-Bet **cannot do sweets**.

Not in the “I prefer savory” sense.

In the **biochemical, existential, and narrative** sense:

- sugar → glycemic spike  
- glycemic spike → insulin requirement  
- insulin requirement → dependence on a substance that QEL immediately classified as a **Biological Coherence Artifact**

### The Event That Created the Legend

In 1997, during the *Never-Ending Birthday Cake Incident* (classified as a “Whipped-Cream Loop”), an intern offered John a slice.

John looked at the cake like it was a portal.

And said:

> “That’s not food. That’s a hypothesis.”

The cake, offended, tried to look less sweet.  
Failed. It was cake.

## 💉 Insulin as a Coherence Artifact

For John Aunt-Bet, insulin is not just medication.

It is an **internal reality regulator**.

QEL@0xpblab, predictably, turned that into a protocol.

### The Lab’s Interpretation

```
No insulin → glucose drifts
Glucose drifting → mood drifts
Mood drifting → decisions drift
Decisions drifting → wrong branch collapses
Wrong branch collapses → extra meeting
Extra meeting → Dr. Null Quorum smiles
```

Result: **insulin became infrastructure**, right next to:

- oscillators
- calibration standards
- and a whiteboard no one is allowed to erase without cosmic authorization

> *“Insulin isn’t health. Insulin is governance.”*  
> — Dr. K., marginal note (dubious, but persuasive)

## 🚪 First Appearance at QEL@0xpblab

John Aunt-Bet first appeared in the cafeteria — the most dangerous place in QEL, because that’s where reality tries to be “normal.”

The scene was logged by three incompatible systems.

### Log A (corporate)

```
EVENT: New collaborator observed
LOCATION: Cafeteria
RISK: Desserts available
ACTION: Monitor
```

### Log B (human)

There was a dessert tray.

John walked past it like someone crossing a minefield with a dress code.

The cook asked:

— “A little sweet?”

John replied:

— “I already have a problem. I don’t need a hobby.”

### Log C (reality)

The tray trembled.

Sugar felt shame.

And ~~Ri~~ck with Fu Monilson, across the cafeteria, whispered:

> “That one is metal without a guitar.”

## 📑 Official Protocols

### Protocol: ANTI-SWEET (v1.0) — “Do not touch the sugared branch”

**Objective:** keep John Aunt-Bet operational in hostile pastry environments.

**Rules:**
1. Never use the phrase “just a tiny piece.”
2. Never begin a sentence with “it’s diet.”
3. Never ask him to “try it and see.”
4. If someone brings cake, activate **Minimum Diplomatic Noise** and pivot the conversation to war.

### Protocol: INSULIN (v2.7) — “Internal coherence”

```
ITEM: Insulin
STATUS: Critical
LOCATION: Storage + pocket + another dimension (redundancy)
FAILURE RISK: High if an optimist offers pudding
```

### Protocol: COOKIE (v0.1) — “Preventive containment”

> “Cookies are sugar’s Trojan horse.”  
> — John Aunt-Bet, in an internal tribunal (won unanimously)

---

## 🧾 Signature Lines

- “Is that dessert or an attempted collapse?”
- “It’s not ‘just’ sugar. It’s an uncontrolled variable.”
- “Diet is a promise. I audit promises.”
- “Sugar is Laplace in gastronomy: it tries to predict happiness.”
- “If I eat this, tomorrow there’s a meeting.”

## 📎 Appendices

### Appendix A — Standard Kit

| Item | Function | Note |
|------|----------|------|
| Pen | Log incidents | Ink is anti-glucose by superstition |
| Stamp | End dessert conversations | Prevents debate |
| Meter | Prove “a little” is a lie | It always is |
| Insulin | Stabilize internal reality | Critical item |
| Swiss watch | Reminder time is real | Unlike pudding |

### Appendix B — FAQ (questions QEL banned)

**Q:** “But can’t you have just a little chocolate?”  
**A:** “I can. I can also cross the street without looking. Both are bad decisions.”

**Q:** “What about sugar-free sweets?”  
**A:** “Then it’s just a lie with marketing.”

**Q:** “But it’s a birthday!”  
**A:** “Reality has a birthday every day. Look at the state it’s in.”

### Appendix C — Narrative Hook

John Aunt-Bet is the only being at QEL@0xpblab capable of:

- preventing Dr. Null Quorum from creating a Dessert Committee
- saying “no” to the universe and staying polite
- detecting **sugar traps** like anti-personnel mines

Which places him at the center of the next conflict:

> **When Laplace tries to stabilize reality with “a little sweet certainty,” John will be the only barrier between the lab and a pudding-shaped collapse.**
