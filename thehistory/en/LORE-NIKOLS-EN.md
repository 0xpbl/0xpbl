## 🧾 Identity

**Name:** Nikols (sometimes “Nicols,” depending on the branch and autocorrect)  
**Profile:** skinny, dramatic, convinced reality “would be better with a soundtrack.”  
**Gift:** dreaming with administrative intensity.  
**Curse:** turning every obligation into a metaphor.

He learned an inconvenient fact early:

- **dreams** are where he’s in charge
- **real life** is where he gets invoices

So he decided:  
if dreams are better… **dreams are work.**

QEL@0xpblab, unfortunately, has HR.

## 🧨 The Problem: Dreaming as Public Policy

Nikols joined the company with a genius plan (meaning: doomed):

> “I’ll solve our problems inside the dream.”

He calls it “applied oneirology.”  
He read a definition online and became unbearable for weeks.  
(“Dreams are science,” he said, while sleeping in meetings.)

The bad part: he started filing dreams as tickets.

### Example of an actual ticket (tragically)

```
SUBJECT: "Dreamed deadlines didn't exist"
SEVERITY: P0 (because I felt it)
EVIDENCE: I woke up sad
ACTION: sleep 90 more minutes to investigate
```

The Chalkboard Auditor wrote:
> “NO.”

Nikols replied:
> “YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND ART.”

The chalkboard went silent, which is how it says “disciplinary process.”

---

## 💍 Why his wife hates him (fairly)

Nikols’ wife hates him for this fully technical stack of reasons:

1) he promises to “change”  
2) and then changes branches

He keeps saying:

> “Babe, I’ll be more present.”

Then he disappears into a 4-hour nap called “research.”

She has caught him:
- hugging a pillow like it’s “destiny”
- arguing with a fan (“that was a multiverse sign”)
- writing poetry in spreadsheet format

Worst part? He uses science as an excuse.

— “You can’t judge me, I’m in REM.”

She replied with a historic line:

> “REM is my ass.”

After that, she banned three words at home:
- “nap”
- “quick rest”
- and “lucid”

---

## 👵 Why his mom hates him (even more fairly)

Nikols’ mom hates him out of tradition and performance.

She raised him on the sentence:

> “If you dream too much, you wake up in debt.”

She believes QEL is “a place where people grow up and become memes.”  
And she’s right.

She calls every day at 6:00 AM just to act as a moral alarm:

— “Are you awake?”

Nikols:
— “Yes.”

Mom:
— “Are you awake for REAL or are you in your… *branch*?”

Nikols, caught:
— “Depends on the observer.”

Mom:
— “I’ll observe you with a sandal.”

And she does.

## 🌪️ The Chaos Day: Operation “REM IS WORK”

**Date:** some random Tuesday (they’re all dangerous).  
**Nikols’ goal:** prove dreaming is productivity.  
**Failure:** the universe.

### 09:10 — The Meeting

Nikols enters the call and announces:

> “Today I’m brainstorming while asleep.”

The team goes quiet.

Old Ed stamps the air:
> “NO.”

Nikols is already fading.

### 09:13 — The Drop

He rests his head on the desk and falls into instant REM (biologically suspicious, lore-approved).

He starts sleep-talking:

— “I saw… I saw… the solution…”

His wife (somehow at the door like a vengeful NPC) asks:

— “What solution?”

Nikols, still asleep:
— “Swap reality for a cheaper one…”

Wife:
— “Swap you for silence.”

### 09:20 — Mom Arrives (because the universe hates peace)

Mom shows up with groceries and certainty:

— “I knew it.”

She doesn’t ask “how did you get into the building.”

At QEL, moms enter through any branch.

She sees Nikols sleeping in a meeting and performs the ancestral ritual:

> raising the sandal.

The whole room feels the sandal’s gravity field.

The chalkboard writes:
> “RISK: IMMINENT.”

Jão Bolão appears with a metal helmet:

— “Want me to forge an anti-sandal protector?”

Mom:
— “I’ll forge him with yelling.”

### 09:23 — The Dream Becomes Evidence (against him)

Nikols half-wakes and tries to defend the thesis:

> “Most dreams are more vivid in REM.”

Nobody asks for a source.

Nobody wants a source.

His wife says:

— “I’m entering REM too: **Removal.**”

And drags him by the collar like a software bug.

### 09:31 — Exit Log

QEL registers:

```
EVENT: Human asset removed (Nikols)
REASON: excessive dreaming in productive environment
AUTHORITY: wife + mom (coalition)
STATUS: under review (by sandal)
```

## 🤝 Interactions with QEL (all bad)

- **With the Chalkboard Auditor:**  
  it writes “WAKE UP” in 18 languages. Nikols reads it as “poetry.”

- **With Old Ed:**  
  Old Ed says: “Dreams are not evidence.”  
  Nikols says: “But they’re feelings.”  
  Old Ed tickets feelings.

- **With Marcelo Marmelo Martelo:**  
  Marcelo says: “Quantum universe is dangerous.”  
  Nikols says: “But it’s beautiful.”  
  Marcelo says: “Beautiful is paying your bills.”

- **With ~~Ri~~ck com Fu Monilson:**  
  the prophet likes Nikols because dreams are infinite choruses.  
  Even so he recommends:  
  “Sleep less. Riff more.”

## 📜 Official Protocols

### Protocol: NO-SLEEP-IN-CALLS (v1.3)

1. If Nikols yawns, turn off his camera.  
2. If Nikols closes his eyes, open a ticket called “WAKE UP.”  
3. If Nikols starts philosophizing, send “👍” and end the meeting.

### Protocol: DOMESTIC COALITION (v0.1)

- If wife and mom are aligned: **do not argue.**
- If the sandal is in superposition (mid-air): **evacuate.**

---

## 🕳️ Epilogue: The Man Who Almost Woke Up

By the end of the day, Nikols looks at reality like it’s an overdue invoice:

> “I just wanted to dream in peace.”

His wife and mom look back with the same answer, in two voices:

> “Then wake up and fix it.”

Nikols sighs.

For the first time, he tries.

He grabs a notebook and writes:

- “dream = good”
- “life = bills”
- “maybe I can… do both?”

The chalkboard, with minimal mercy, writes:

> **CONSISTENT ENOUGH.**

At QEL, that’s basically love.
